Installation
============

To install Critic, run the script install.py as root.  It will ask a
number of question and then perform the installation.  In short, what
it does is:

  * Check for and/or install required software packages.

  * Create a system user (typically named "critic") and group (also
    typically named "critic").

  * Generate system configuration into /etc/critic/.

  * Install the source code into /usr/share/critic/.

  * Create a PostgreSQL user and database, both named "critic".

  * Create a System-V style init script, /etc/init.d/critic-main, and
    create links to it in the /etc/rcN.d/ directories.

  * Enable the Apache modules mod_expires and mod_wsgi.

  * Create an Apache site named "critic-main" and enable it.


Required Software Packages
--------------------------

Critic depends on the following software packages:

  * PostgreSQL (8.4 or later)

  * Apache (2.2 or later; 2.4 has not been tested)

  * Git

  * Python (2.7 or later; 3.x is not supported)

  * Non-standard Python modules:

    - bcrypt (if Critic does user authentication)

    - psycopg2

Note that on Debian/Ubuntu systems, the install.py script can install
all of these software packages automatically.
